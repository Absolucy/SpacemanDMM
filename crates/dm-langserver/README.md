# DreamMaker Language Server

This package is a [language server] implementation for DreamMaker, the
scripting language of the [BYOND] game engine. All features are dependent on
client support.

* [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platymuus.dm-langclient)
  ([code](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/vscode-dm-langclient)).
* [Sublime Text 3 package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/DreamMaker%20Language%20Client)
  ([code](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/sublime-dm-langclient)).
* Other editors may have generic language client packages which will be
  compatible.
